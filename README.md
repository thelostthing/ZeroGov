### AN IDEA. 

To **REPLACE** all governments on the Earth.

Or **INITIALIZE** human society on a new planet.


> Treat each human **EQUALITY** and **NO MORE PRIVACY**.

> Human groups-ed freely, from single, block, city, to whole planet.

> To make things happen, human vote, for which that affect groups who belonged mostly.

> More flexable LAW with human natural instincts considered. 
Optional: Can be understood by computer, judged by computer, and given just advice.

***

> Main purpose of law: 

* Make sure each human grow up healthy.

* Make sure each human educated enough, to understand each other world-wide.

* Make sure LAW updateable anytime and anywhere, to meet huamn's current needs.

* Help instead force human to accept this system.
