### AN IDEA. 

To **REPLACE** all governments on the Earth 
Or **INIT** human society on a new planet.


> Treat every human as an node EQUALITY and NO MORE PRIVACY;

> Huamn are grouped(like from one small family group to whole plant, one single human can group self), 
when vote decision, affect mostly on samllest group belonged,
to do a big decision plant-wide, need almost all human living plant-wide to vote.


> More flexable LAW, considered human's light and dark side. 
Optional: Can be understand by computer, judge by computer to give just advice.

> Main purpose of law: 
* make sure each human grow up healthy, 
* make sure each human education enough to understand each other world-wide,
* make sure law updateable anytime, anywhere to meet huamn's current need,
* may sure human accept this system, without brainwash but human-self thinking considered the time and place living (cause one day, someone or group who very smart and very selfish may use this system to do things bad to human)


> No more real money, Every huamn has an default bitcoin-like(privacy removed?) 'private money account';

>No more unfair Tax, each 'money account' freeze some percentage belongs to 'public money accounts' based on income and (?,?,) (rules voteable);

>No more cufused Tax using, what to use on(education, police.. all powered by company to earn money from public), where use in, when using, who get the tax money, all details trackable as tax giver.
